# elf2uf2

Files are taken from <https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/tree/master/tools/elf2uf2> and <https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/common/boot_uf2/include/boot/uf2.h>

I added some extra valid address ranges for the peripherals to `main.cpp` so it doesn't throw an error.
